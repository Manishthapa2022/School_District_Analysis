# **School District Analysis** #
___
## Overview ##
As a data analyst, I am tasked by my manager Maria to provide a detailed analysis on the file which has the student records from all the schools in the district. These analysis will then be shared with the School board. The data set used for this analysis was new_file_student_data.csv and the analysis was carried out using PythonData and Jupyter Notebook
___
## Results ##
Based on the analysis carried out on the file, the following observations were made:

* The average reading score for students accross all grades and schools was higher at 72.357865 as compared to average maths score at 64.675733, although the standard deviation was almost the same for both Maths and Reading at approx 15. Similiar trend was seen when analysis was carried out for Grades 11 and 12 students with average reading score at 74.9004 and average math score at 63.2585
* The minimum reading score was 10.5 by Mathew Thomas, Grade 10, from Dixon High School which is a Charter school.
* The Charter schools have a lower average budget at 872625.656 when compared to Public schools at 911195.558.
* The Charter schools had higher average maths score (66.761883) when compared to Public Schools(62.951576), although there was no marked difference in their reading scores. Charter schools mean reading score was at 72.450603 when compared to Public schools at 72.281219. It can be seen that irrespective of the school type, students on an average performed well in reading as compared to maths.
* When a student count against the individual school was carried out, it was found that some schools had a very high enrollment rate as compared to others. for eg. Montgomery High School had the highest enrollment at 2038 and Chang High School had the lowest at 171. The difference between them is approx 11.91 times.
* Finally when an analysis of the average math score by school type and grade was carried out, it was found that for Charter schools, grade 9th had the highest average score at 70.0 and grade 12 had the lowest at 60.0. Incase of public schools, the average maths grade was almost similiar for grades 9th, 10th, 12th at approx 64, but grade 11th average score was at 59.0.
## Analysis Summary ##
It can be seen that the average reading score is higher than average maths score for schools when compared accross all grades and school type. The charter school had a lower average budget when compared to public schools, although there was no marked difference in the their average reading scores, but charter schools did fairly well than public schools in average maths score. This suggests that there were other factors in play and further information on the allocation of resources (budget) would shed more light. Also, enrollment of students against the school type, student teacher ratio against the school type and funds allocated accross other subjects and sports against the school type will also help to provide more in depth analysis.
